# Yahoo Fantasy Baseball API Reader

Want to download your fantasy baseball data from Yahoo but having a hard time interfacing with their poorly documented API? 

This tool is for you.

- Installation
- Usage
- Yahoo's API docs

If you want a more advanced tool, see my [Yahoo Fantasy Baseball Automater](https://github.com/edwarddistel/yahoo-fantasy-baseball-automater), which attempts to start an optimal lineup for you based on your team vs the day's probably pitchers.

Also, this is written in NodeJS. If you prefer PHP I have a primitive version of this in /php-version.

## Installation

### Part 1: Get access codes from Yahoo
1. Log into Yahoo
2. Navigate to https://developer.yahoo.com/apps/create/
3. Fill out the form
    - Application Name (Whatever)
    - Description (Whatever)
    - Homepage URL (anything, e.g. www.github.com)
    - Redirect URI(s) (anything, e.g. www.github.com)
    - API Permissions (checkmark Fantasy Sports, then Read/Write)
    - ![](/screenshots/yahoo-1.png)
4. Create App
5. Yahoo will give you 3 values. Write down the last two:
    - App ID (don't care)
    - Client ID/Consumer Key
    - Client Secret/Consumer Secret
    - ![](/screenshots/yahoo-2.png)    
6. However the above codes are **not enough** to interface with the Yahoo Fantasy API. Take the `Client ID/Consumer Key` from above and paste it into the following URL:
    
https://api.login.yahoo.com/oauth2/request_auth?client_id=YOUR-CLIENT-ID-GOES-HERE&redirect_uri=oob&response_type=code&language=en-us

7. Enter that URL into your browser.
8. Agree to allow access for your app.
 - ![](/screenshots/yahoo-4.png)

9. Grab the code Yahoo now gives you.
 - ![](/screenshots/yahoo-5.png)


### Part 2: Configure this app

10. [Install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (Check the .nvmrc file for version but most versions should work)
11. Clone this repo
12. In the repo directory type `npm install`
13. Optional: To make sure you're using the right version NodeJS, type in `nvm use`. If you get an error message that `nvm` cannot be found, install it (e.g. [Mac](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/nvm)) and try again
14. Rename `config.json.example` to `config.json` and open it in a text editor
15. Enter in the following values and save:
    - `CONSUMER_KEY`: Obtained from Yahoo in step 5 above
    - `CONSUMER_SECRET`: Also obtained from Yahoo in step 5 above
    - `YAHOO_AUTH_CODE`: Obtained from Yahoo in step 9 above (**not the App ID in step 5!**)
    - `LEAGUE_KEY`: the League Key has three parts: 
        - (1) a unique prefix Yahoo randomly assigns each season
        - (2) the string ".l." (that's a lowercase L)
        - (3) the unique ID of your league
        - E.g.: `431.l.123456`
        - To find out this number:
            - If it's 2023 and baseball, the unique prefix for MLB is `431`. 
            - You can find out the league prefix by running:
            ```
            nvm use
            (if necessary install the appopriate version of node)
            npm install
            npm start
            npm run league-prefix
            ```
            - You can find your league ID simply by logging into the Yahoo Fantasy Baseball website - it'll be the value after `https://baseball.fantasysports.yahoo.com/b1/`
            - Combine those two with ".l." for a final format of `412.l.123456`
    - `TEAM`: This is your team number.
        - Just log into the Yahoo Fantasy Baseball website, click on "My Team", then check the URL to see what team number you are. Usually 1-8
    - `AUTH_FILE`: Where to store the credentials. Can be anything you want.
    - `FREE_AGENTS`: How many "pages" of free agents to request from Yahoo, 25 at a time. E.g. 0 = first 25 free agents by rank in the league, 1 = 50, 2 = 75, etc.

## Usage
### Run the app

Navigate to the repo directory and run:
```
> npm run start
```


By default this app will pull in the following data:

```json
const allData = {
    "free agents": freeAgents, 
    "my players": myPlayers, 
    "my players' stats": myPlayersStats, 
    "my scoreboard": myScoreboard, 
    "stat IDs": statsIDs, 
    "current roster": currentRoster, 
    "transactions": transactions
};
```

And write this JSON object to a file, `allMyData.json`.  From there you should be able to consume and manipulate your data.

This may or may not include your desired data set, but you should be able to use this template to pull in whatever you want. The Yahoo API docs are not great so I've summarized them below.

## Yahoo Fantasy API Docs
### Overview of Endpoints/Resources
There's [Yahoo's official guide](https://developer.yahoo.com/fantasysports/guide) but it's not great. All of the info below is from their website, just more organized.

First, an overview of the "Resources" (aka endpoints) Yahoo makes available:

![Yahoo Fantasy API](/screenshots/plectica-small.png)

- **Player**
    - Player stats & info, [docs](https://web.archive.org/web/20131003155757/https://developer.yahoo.com/fantasysports/guide/player-resource.html)
- **Game**
    - individual game data, [docs](https://web.archive.org/web/20131003155757/https://developer.yahoo.com/fantasysports/guide/game-resource.html)
- **League**
    - info about your league, [docs](https://web.archive.org/web/20131003155757/https://developer.yahoo.com/fantasysports/guide/league-resource.html)
- **Team**
    - stats, standings and roster info about your team, [docs](https://web.archive.org/web/20131003155757/https://developer.yahoo.com/fantasysports/guide/team-resource.html)
- **Roster**
    - manage your roster, [docs](https://web.archive.org/web/20131003155757/https://developer.yahoo.com/fantasysports/guide/roster-resource.html)
- **Transaction**
    - monitor or make transactions, [docs](https://web.archive.org/web/20131003155757/https://developer.yahoo.com/fantasysports/guide/transaction-resource.html)
- **User**
    - info about the Yahoo user, [docs](https://web.archive.org/web/20131003155757/https://developer.yahoo.com/fantasysports/guide/user-resource.html)

Except for "Roster", all other 6 endpoints also offer groups of items called "Collections" (instead of "Resources"). Basically the same content, just more than one item at a time.

### Subresouces

Each endpoint has subresources that can be accessed:
